# Back to the Future: Cinema is the new DeLorean

## Abstract

The movie industry has in the late 19th and early 20th century developed massively from a very luxurious to a widespread and cheap activity to the 
point where in the 1920s it could be considered common to watch a movie. The societies have in the past century gone through a huge evolution with 
a lot of dramatic event such as wars and nuclear fear but also many technological advances, to the point that it could be argued that there has 
never been such fast changements in societies. This fast changing society and movie industry have evolved along sides through major historical 
events, theses events have obviously impacted heavily the populations, and we therefore wonder to what extent the film production and society are 
closely linked together. This is equivalent to asking if major historical events have been translated into the productions of movies. Following 
this question, we also want to observe how films with a strong link to historical event have been received by the general public. To answer this we 
will use the movie corpus dataset along with the IMDb database. Using NLP and statistic pipelines we will try to observe trends that can answer our 
questions.
